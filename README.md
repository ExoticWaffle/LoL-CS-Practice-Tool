# LoL-CS-Practice-Tool
I made a practice tool for LoL CSing, using the java slick2d library. There's no actual textures, but the mechanics are pretty accurate to LoL.
You need to download slick2d and lwjgl to run this. Download them here:

LWJGL 2.9.3 (doesn't work with LWJGL3): http://legacy.lwjgl.org/download.php.html
